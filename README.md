# Coalition_Dynamics_Noe_1994
A re-derivation of Ronald Noe's 1994 mathematical model of coalition formation dynamics in savannah baboons. The main contribution here is the design of an algorithm which automates the mathematical work done in the original paper.

Please read the `ABOUT.md` file before going playing around with the code itsself. It contains essential background information about the system being modeled as well as details pertaining to the algorithm and how to operate the program.

If you are interested in a more detailed background of the model system or would like to see how I formalized the explicit assumptions of Noe(1994) mathematically when designing the algorithm, I also encourage you to read
the `BACKGROUND_AND_DESIGN.md` file as well.
